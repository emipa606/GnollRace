Chuckly, violent, cannibal-prone hyena folk. Organized in loose tribes, they’re fond of plaguing other settlements for easy meals and materials.

NEW SPRITES:Special thanks to Rebelrot96

Racial Stats:
Gnolls are tough. All and all they can withstand a little more abuse than a normal human, resist poison and recover from diseases somewhat faster than normal.

Gnolls aren’t very well liked. Malodorous and sporting wicked laughs, Gnolls are awful conversationalists all around. Don’t expect a gnoll negotiator to do too well.

Gnolls aren’t agrarian. They’d rather hunt for their food, and it shows in any attempts at farming. Yields are slightly (10% less) smaller.

Gnolls hit hard. They punch harder, and have a bite attack too.

Gnolls are brutish. While they’ll complain about eating kibble and sleeping on the floor, they care little of death and destruction. They like meat, no matter where it’s from.
